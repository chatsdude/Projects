# Natural Language to Dashboard Engine for Manufacturing Alarms

This project enables users to ask natural language questions about **alarm events in a manufacturing plant**, and automatically generates relevant **SQL queries**, **aggregations**, and **visual dashboards** — without needing technical expertise.

## What It Does

- Converts **natural language questions** into **SQL queries** over a manufacturing alarm database.
- Automatically generates **interactive dashboards** (bar charts, bar drilldowns etc.) for visualization.
- Uses **LangGraph** and **LangChain** to create an **agentic workflow**, handling multi-step reasoning such as:
  - Query interpretation
  - Metadata awareness
  - Chart type suggestion
  - Response summarization

---

## Features

- **NL → SQL**: Schema-aware LLM prompting to convert plain English to valid SQL queries.
- **Auto Dashboards**: Renders charts based on query intent using `Plotly` and `Streamlit`.
- **LangGraph-based Agent**: Multi-node agent handles parsing, querying, rendering, and responding.
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Implements schema-anchored prompting and few-shot examples to improve fidelity.
- **Configurable Backend**: Works with SQLite based alarm datasets.
